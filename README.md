# Big data analysis
 I use R to finish these projects.
## Project1 - Decision tree
In this project, I use `rpart` , `tree` and `randomForest` to  forecast iris database. Besides, I decide how many trees to ude in randomFprest package.
## Project2 - SVM&Logistics Model
In this project, I use `SVM model`  and `Logistics model` to  forecast Accidents data.Moreover, I compare the accuracy to these models. 
## Project3 - statistical tests and linear regression
In this project, I use `t-test` to analyze the differnce of cars between people who live in city and country.Also, I develope the `linear regression` to find out that trips will increase because of numbers of workers and household people.
## Project4 - graphics
I use ggplot to visualize data. I have facet and smooth iris data. Besides, I draw the bubble-plot with mcars.
## Project5 - ETL
I use ubike data in Taipei to find out the use rate in 信義區 between sunny and rainy day. I also find the most ubike in 信義區 at 8 a.m.
